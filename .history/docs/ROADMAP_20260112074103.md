# 🎨 Flexibility Guidelines

**This roadmap is a living document.**

**Principles:**
1. **Ship fast, iterate:** Better to launch with 6 good games than wait for 10 perfect ones
2. **Listen to users:** If beta testers want X feature, adjust priorities
3. **Quality over quantity:** A few great games > many mediocre ones
4. **Momentum matters:** Keep shipping regularly, don't go dark
5. **Protect the vision:** Free, accessible, high-quality always

**When to adjust:**
- User feedback reveals different priorities
- Technical blockers require rethinking
- Opportunity for partnership/feature emerges
- Burnout risk - extend timeline
- Moving faster than expected - pull features forward
