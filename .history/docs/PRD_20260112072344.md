## 📋 Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Game Night  
**Tagline:** "Free party games for friends, anywhere"  
**Type:** Progressive Web App (PWA)  

**One-Liner:**  
Game Night is a free, web-based suite of popular party games that enables groups of friends and families to host game nights virtually or in-person, without accounts, subscriptions, or complicated setup.

A web-based game platform that:
- Requires zero setup (no accounts, no downloads)

## 🚫 Non-Goals (What We're NOT Building)

### Explicitly Out of Scope

1. **No User Accounts**
   - No login, no passwords, no profiles
   - One-time sessions only
   - Reasoning: Simplicity, privacy, faster start

2. **No Monetization**
   - No ads
   - No premium features
   - No in-app purchases
   - Reasoning: Commitment to accessibility

3. **No Large-Scale Lobbies**
   - Max 16 players per game
   - Not building for 50+ player events
   - Reasoning: Party game focus, not massive multiplayer

4. **No Complex 3D Graphics**
   - 2D card games and simple visuals
   - Not building immersive 3D worlds
   - Reasoning: Performance, accessibility, scope

5. **No Persistent Progression**
   - No levels, no unlocks, no achievements (initially)
   - Each game is standalone
   - Reasoning: Casual focus, no account system

6. **No Mobile Game Mechanics**
   - Not building Candy Crush-style games
   - Not building idle games or gachas
   - Reasoning: Party game focus

7. **No Server Dependency (Initially)**
   - Games work offline when possible
   - P2P or client-side logic preferred
